  4. whiler there are unconnected rooms
    a. attempt to connect to a neightboring connected room
  5. Make random connects between rooms

  7 Scan map fo corrdidor squares with 2 bordering walls, 1-2 bordering rooms, and 0-1 bordering corridor
  8.

### Angband
- Developed in 1990
- Generation:
  1. Dungeon is 256x256 cells
  2. Divided into 11x11 grids
  3. A room will fill up 33x11 block. Attempt to place a room over 3 side by side grids. If room overlaps existing rooms, dont add, repeat for 50 rooms
  4. Attempt to connect all rooms with each other
      - When attempting to connect rooms
  5. Once a level is generated, objects and creatires are placed

### Binding of Isaac
- 2011
- Tile based generation
  - Always 4 core rooms
    - Treause room
    - Boss room
    - Shop
    - Secret Room
  - 5 - 20 non core rooms from predefined rooms
- An example of how more modern games will not generate everything, but randomly mix in hand made things
- Enemy Generation
  - Base enemies with randomly assigned traits
- Other generated traits
  - Random items drops at the end of clearing a room
  - secret rooms: Arcade, challenge rooms, mini boss, mystery rooms
  - Bosses are randomly picked from a pool of 4-5 bosses per chapter

### Spelunky
- Generation
  - Each level is 4x4 grid of rooms
  - Each rooms is 10x8 grid of tiles
  - 4 areas: Mines, Jungle, Ice cave
  - 4 levels per area
- Level characteristics
  - Levels start at entrance at to and exit at bottom
  - Path to exit must be reachable without items
  - Algorithm must not create areas where player can get stuck have to use an item to escape
  - Make edges of the rooms as hard to notice as possible
- Generation with some game design behind it
- Algorithm
  1. Path generation: `scrLevelGen()`
      - Mark one top room as entrance
      - Randomly walk down, left or right
      - if edge hit go down
      - when can't go farther, place exit
  2. Room generation: `scrRoomGen()`
      - Per room randomly select a premade room template (string of characters) depending on the room number
      - Each number is assigned a different tile type
  3. Entity Generation: `scrEntityGen()`
      - Check floor tiles and decides whether to generate an entity

### Path of Exile
- Generation
  - Begin with a start and end
  - Preset templates of rooms for different areas are random places to fill in space in between and around the two points
  - Add weights to the rooms based on certain factors like the direct path between the start and end
  - Use weights to determine enemy difficulty and loot
  - Use weights to shortest path between points
  - Branching factor added to add variety
