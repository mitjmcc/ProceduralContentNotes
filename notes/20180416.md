## Dungeon Generation
- Jonathan Hunter

### Definition
- No single definition
- Common goal of creating a space for a player to play in procedurally

### Generation Structure
- Select data structure
- 

### Types of Generation


### 2D vs 3D
- 

### Tile Based Approach
- 2D
- Start with a set of rooms of different shapes
- Place the rooms
- Ensured connections
- Connect together like puzzle pieces
- Major amount of manual efffort
- Like in Warframe

### Cellular Automata
- Mostly used for room generation
- Start with grid
- Cells are either full or empty
- For each square grab its neighbors
- Count how many are alive
- Index into table and place dead/alive value into current cell
- Fast to calculate, Organic looking
- Hard to control output bc of lots of rule set tuning
- Can smooth blockiness of corners
  - Marching squares
  - Flood fill placing smooth items along edges

### Generative Grammars
- Set of words (rooms) that can be placed into sentences
- Arrange sentences into a directed graph following the grammar rules
- Allows for high level control to specify certain things to happen
- Big time investment to set up

### Genetic Algorithm
- Generate levels at random and genetic algoritm picks the most "fit" one
- Define a fitness function to determine how "good" a layout is
- Produces nice results
- Fitness functions must be a mathmetical representation which is hard to define

### Constraint Based
- Generate a 3D undirected graph
- Use a series of rules to control how the graph is generated
- Place prefab geometry in the scene based on the 3d graph
- No real control, can only specify what we don't want

### Tunnel and Place
- Simple Algorithm
  - Start with seed room
  - Place path to connected to room
  - Place room connected to ath
  - Repeat
- Explicit
``` c
Room r = PlaceRoom(randomPos());
Tunnel t = PlaceTunnel(r);
tunnels.Add(t);
while (tunnels.Count > 0 && rooms < RoomsMax) {
    t = tunnels[0];
    r = PlaceRoom(t.end());
    if (r == null) // Couldnt find a room
        Delete(t); // Remove tunnel
    else {
        room++;
        temp = PlaceTunnel(r);
        if (temp != null)
            tunnels.Add(temp);
        if (Random() < 0.7) {
            temp = PlaceTunnel(r)
            if (temp != null)
                tunnels.Add(temp)
        }
    }
    tunnels.Remove(t); // With a list need to pop this way
}
```
- Placing a Room
``` c
placeRoom(Vector3 pos) {
    // Check for Collision
    // Check within overall dungeon bounds
}
```
- Placing a tunnel
``` c
placeTunnel(Room room) {
    // Go through cardinal direction randomly remove direction bias
    foreach(shuffle(direction)) { 
        // Check for Collision
        // Check withing bounds of Dungeon
        if (both true)
            return tunnel;
    }
}
```
- Can represent as a tree and easily place lock/key semantics

### Gridbased
- Place rrooms on grid
- Paths between rooms are implicit
- Room placement can be done woth any method
- Allows more focus on rooms
- Restricted on how rooms are connected

### Layer based Generation
- Jonathan's research
- Full 3D generation
- General Algorithm
  - Placerooms on 2D plane (Poisson disk/jittered sampling)
  - Repeate for multiple floors
  - Connect rooms on different floors to form multifloor paths
  - 
  - Marching cubes
  - Extrude 2D planes to create the 3D rooms
