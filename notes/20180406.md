## Traffic
- Grand Theft Auto
- Sim City
- Cities: Skylines

### Traffic Animation Issues
- Car following
  - One car should not run into the one in front of it
- Lane Changing
  - Many paper
- Intersections
  - Almost entirely ignored in literature

### Sources and Destinations of cars
- Home
- Work, School, etc
- restaurant, shop

### Tiled Streets
- Cases:
  - Straight: 2 orientations
  - ![](images/streetStraight.png)
  - Fourway intersection
  - ![](images/street4Way.png)
  - Turn: 4 orientations
  - ![](images/streetTurn.png)
- Handling decisions:
  - Only decision need to make is at intersection
  - Once decided whether to turn or go straight
  - Reuse behaviour from straight and turn
- Queues: Each straight or turn tile has 2 queues
  - Straight:
    - ![](images/trafficQueues.png)
    - East bound queue: A, B
    - Westbound queue: C
    - ![](images/trafficQueues2.png)
    - When car leaves queue of one tile, it enters queue of next tile
- Labeling of tiles:
  - Turns
  - ![](images/4turnstogether.png)
  - 4 Turn tiles
  - 2 queues per tile: 0 (inner) and  1 (outer)
  - Straight
  - ![](images/straightLabel.png)
  - 4 way
  - ![](images/4waylabel.png)

### Connection Table
| In Tile | Out Tile | Queue In | Queue Out |
| ---     | ---      | ---      | ---       |
| 6       | 0        | 0        | 0         |
| 5       | 0        | 0        | 1         |
| 5       | 4        | 1        | 0         |
- Queue Out is the answer to which queue to enter
- Queue out for tile 4: stop at what point in the intersection?

### Intersection Handling
- ![](images/intersectionHandling.png)
- One car at a time has right-of-way
- first come, first serve
- Store cars in list (queue): A, B
- ![](images/intersectionHandlingGeom.png)
- Arcs for the car to follow along

### Speed of Car:
- desired Velocity
- position andvelocity of lead car
#### IDM - Intelligent Driver Model

| Symbol            | Meaning           | Common Values |
|---                |---                |---            |

- Each car calculates current safe distance to next car

- New acceleration is the combination of 2 items:
