## Unity Overview

### Space
- ground plane is xz plane
- left handed coordinates

### Object Transformation
- Translate: shift an objects position, adding delta to position coordinates
- Scale: change the size of objects, multiplying position coordinates by uniform/nonuniform delta
- Rotation: change the orientation of objects, calculating new points based on coordinates and sin/cos of the theta rotating by
- Transformation order matters, does not always commute

### Object Hierarchy
- Objects made of a tree of subobjects
- Parents and children
- Local transformations
- Transformation of an object goes in order from local rotation to scale to position then to parent rotation to parent scale, etc
