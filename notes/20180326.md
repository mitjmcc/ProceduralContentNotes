## Keyframe Animation
- Most basic way of animating on a computer
- Many aspects of a model can be animated:
  - position
  - orientation
  - color
  - anything with a number
- Animation examples:
  - bouncing ball
  - fading ghost
- Channel: a single numeric value that can change over time
  - ex y coordinate of a position
### Ball example
- ![](images/keyframeBall.png)
1. start with t<sub>y</sub> = 8 at frame 0
2. change t<sub>y</sub> = 1 at frame 24
3. change t<sub>y</sub> = 8 at frame 48

- Interpolating channel values between keyframes:
  - Catmull Rom Spline (above)
  - Linear interpolation

### Humans and Animals
- Articulated Models
  - models with joints
- use a skeleton (rig): made of bones and joints
  - joint: a position and an orientation
  - bone: two joints and the length between them
  - ![](images/jointandbone.png)
  - Root joint: the position it set directly
  - Rigging: creating joints and bones tied to a mesh by skinning
  - Bind (neutral) pose: for skinning

### Skinning
- mesh points associated with bones

- Weights: values on vertices that determine how much the motion of a bone affects the position of a vertex
- ![](images/skinningWeights2.png)
- Coordinate frame
  - v = bone1(v<sub>bind</sub>)
  - v<sub>bind</sub>: original position of vertex
  - New vertex position is the weighted sum of positions realative to the bones:
  - v' = w1 * bone1(v<sub>bind</sub>) + w2 * bone2(v<sub>bind</sub>)
