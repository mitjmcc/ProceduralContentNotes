## Key Frame Animation, Part Deux
### Forward Kinematics
- Directly change joint orientations
- ![](images/forwardKin.png)
  - Rotates around Joint 2 
  - Everything outward (from root) is affected
### Inverse Kinematics
- Drag a joints position
- System solves for joint angles
- ![](images/inverseKin.png)
- IK issues:
  - Often more than one solution - need to find good one
  - Solving can require sophisticated algorithm
  - Slower than forward kinematics

## Spore Creature Animation
- Animating a character you have never seen

### Character motions
- Exs
  - Reaching for fruit
  - pound ground
  - clap

### Select Body Part(s)
- Typical Biped ("Rest Pose")
  - ![](images/bipedRest.png)
- Permutation: 4 arms
  - ![](images/bipedPerm.png)
- Semantics: Give body parts capabilties:
  - grasper (hand)
  - foot
  - mouth
  - spine
  - root
- Animator specifies capabilities of parts to move
- Ex
  - Animator wants grasper
  - maybe 2 or 4 parts
  - animator narrows list with _spatial query_
- Spatial Query:
  - front/center/back
  - left/center/right
  - top/center/bottom
  - Top and Left
    - ![](images/topleftQuery.png)
    - Relative to the whole body
  - Top and Left
    - ![](images/topLeftGrasper.png)
    - Relative to all graspers

#### Local Coordinate frames
- Animator wants creature to wave
  - ![](images/creatureWave.png)
- Actual creature is of a different scale
  - ![](images/actaulCreature.png)
- 2D Example of solution
  - ![](images/localCoordSemantic.png)
- Animator selects whether an animation scales with body size
- Relative to the ground
  - ![](images/relativeToGround.png)
- Relative to External object
