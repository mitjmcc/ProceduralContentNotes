## Performance Optimization

### Frame Rate
- frames drawn per second
  - hertz (Hz)
  - frames per second (fps)
- high quality = 60 fps
- 30 Hz is ok
  - standard video frame rate
- slower -> laggy, unresponsive

### What affects frame rate?
- GPU
  - graphics
- CPU
  - everything else
- Determining bottleneck
  - You can guess
  - Use a profiler

### Profiler
- Tool that records what parts of code are visited the most
- Special code placed in your code, code that does visit gets counted

### Object Pooling
- Create/destroy often
  - bullets, trees, coins, enemies, particles
- Problems
  - Creation/destruction is slow
  - memory can get fragmented
  - may cause garbage collection
- Solutions
  - don't create or destroy
  - reuse old objects
  - Create pool (lost) of the specific object
  - Mark all object as "not in use"
  - Get new object: find unused object in ist, mark as "in use"
  - Throw out object: Mark object as "not in use"
- Gotchas
  - Waste memory on unused objects
  - Need to handle case of all objects "in use"
  - May interact poorly with garbage collection

### Batching
- When rendering objects, changing between materials is slow
- Context Switch
- Context includes:
  - Transormations (rotate, scale, etc)
  - Shading model (diffuse, specular)
  - Lights
  - Textures
- Avoid contex switching:
  - Find groups of objects (batches) that canbe drawn together
  - Batched objects must have same context:
    - Stay in same position relative to each other
    - Same materials (eg all equally shiny)
    - Same lights
    - Same textures
- texture atlas (one big texture)
  - combining textures to batch them together
  - reducing draw calls

### Tranlucent Objects
- alpha (α) = opacity
- α = 0 transparent
- α = 1 opaque
- α in between, translucent
- Drawing Translucent in Rasterization renderers
  1. Render all opaque objects
  2. Render translucent objects next
      - Sort back to front
``` c
pixel_color = foreground_color * α + background_color * (1 - α)
```
- Example
  - Tree in front of mountain range
  - `leaf color * 0.4 + mountain color * 0.6`

### Billboards
- use translucent textures as tree stand-ins, for example
- As tree or object is farther away, replace it with billboard
