## Texture Synthesis

### Example-Based Texture Synthesis
- Source Image
  - Given to you
  - Smaller, sometimes even 64x64
- Target Image
  - larger

### Pixel Neighborhoods
- Region around a given pixel
- example 5x5 grid (non causal)
- dist(N, N<sub>2</sub>)
  - comparing numerically

### Algorithm
- Initialize target by randomly copying pixels from source
- For each pixel (x,y) in target
    - Build neightborhood Nt around (x,y)
    - D<sub>best</sub> = big 
    - C<sub>best</sub> = null
    - For each pixel x', y' in source
        - Build neighbor N<sub>S</sub> around x',y'
        - if (dist(N<sub>S</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>) < - D<sub>best</sub>)
            - D<sub>best</sub> = dist(N<sub>S</sub>, - N<sub>t</sub>)
            - C<sub>best</sub> = source_color(x', y')
    - target_color(x, y) = C<sub>best</sub>
- Use toroidal wrapping to take care of edges
- dist(N<sub>S</sub>, N<sub>t</sub>) = sum of squared differences

### Fixes
- 5x5 causal neighborhood

### Image Pyramid
- Big at the base down to a pixel
- Average colors down into smaller images
- Low Pass filter: Gaussian blur/filter image then sample every other pixel into smaller image.

### New Pyramid Algorithm
- copy random pixels source -> target
- perform 1 level synthesis at level k
- for level = k -1 down to 0
  - perform synthesis with 2 levels of pyramid
  - (One non causal at K and one causal at K-1)

### Generated texture on a surface
- finding points along the model
- vector fields
