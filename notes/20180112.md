## Unity Overview

### Space
- ground plane is xz plane
- left handed coordinates

### Object Transformation
- Translate: shift an objects position, adding delta to position coordinates
- Scale: change the size of objects, multiplying position coordinates by uniform/nonuniform delta
- Rotation: change the orientation of objects, calculating new points based on coordinates and sin/cos of the theta rotating by
- Transformation order matters, does not always commute

### Object Hierarchy
- Objects made of a tree of subobjects
- Parents and children
- Local transformations
- Transformation of an object goes in order from local rotation to scale to position then to parent rotation to parent scale, etc

### Diffuse Surfaces

- **N**: surface normal, unit vector exactly perpendicular to the surface at a point
- **L**: unit vector towards light
- **θ**: angle between N and L
- intensity proportional to `cos(θ) = N dot L`
- per vertex surface normals
- **shared**: different adjacent triangles on a mesh share same vertex normals, looks smooth
- **split**: adjacent triangles have different vertex normals for their shared vertices, sharp edge
