## Branching Structures

- Streets and Trees

- L-systems (graph generator)

- Parish and Muller

- Repeat: by L
  - Elongate at the top, leave behind new segment
  - `xnew = x + L * cos( theta )`
  - `ynew = x + L * sin( thta )`

- dots: branch event
- tip: deadend
```

  _.___.____.

```

### Branches

- One sided
- Two sided

- Another way:
  - `distance_to_branch = random(minDist, maxDist);`

- Growing tip's behavior can be modified:
  - turn to avoid obstacles, eg water, park
```
            | //////
  _.___.____. //////
              //////
```
  - stop at another street, am I intersecting another street?
```
            |
  _.___.____.
            |
```
  - turn to connect to intersection
```
              |
  _.___.____  .___

```

### Full Street System
- Goals:
  - grow main highways
  - fill in smaller resident streets

### Main Highways
- maps of obstacles in grayscale to guide the highway
  - map of water
  - highways go along side of water
- maps of population density
  - highways connect areas of high density
- maps of elevation
  - highway runs down hill
  - perpendicular

### Resident
- determining closed and open sections of highways
- filling in closed sections with grids

### Styles of Cities
- Possible:
  - random branching
  - New York, grids
  - Paris (circular city center)
  - San Fran (guided by elevation)

### "Infrusture 
- Esch, Wonka, Muller, Zhangh
- Siggraph 2007

- 2D symmetric tensors encode direction (similar to vectors)
  - vector: location, direction, magnitude
  - tensor: location, magnitude
```
M = (cos2θ sin2θ)   M = |cos2θ sin2θ|
                        |sin2θ cos2θ|
```
- create grids of tensors
- roads follow tensors

### Voronoi Regions
- Cells created around point
- Within the region, a location is closest to the point the region belongs to
- Once you cross the line, you enter another region of another point
