## Final Texture Mapping

- Perlin noise dead end?

###  Texture Bombing
- Pick random points
- anything within radius of points get a certain color
- good for polka dots

### Worley Patterns
- F<sub>1</sub>(p) = distance to nearest "random" point to p
- p = (x, y, z)
- F<sub>2</sub>(p) = ditance to second nearest point
- F1 looks like a distance transform
- ![](F1)
- F2-F1 looks like a Voronoi
- ![](F2)
- Properties:
  - 0 <= F<sub>1</sub>(p) <= F<sub>2</sub>(p) <= F<sub>3</sub>(p) <= ...

###
- Drawing cells
- For example placing 2 points per cell
- Flawed method, test which cell P is in, find nearest point within the cell
- Better method: loop through current and surrounding cells, 26 surrounding cells in 3d
![](cell)
- Worley did not want to store point locations
- Hash function: cell(i, j, k) -> hash -> one random ceed

- Worley found fixing number of points per cell to not be natrual

### Poisson random distributino
- says chance of given # of points in a cell
- density k (points / cell)
- Probability (m points in cell) = P(m) = k<sup>m</sup> / (e<sup>m</sup> * m!)
- Let K = 1, density of 1
  - P(m) = 1 /(e * m!)

### Calculating F1(p)
1. caculate cell position (i, j, k) from p = (x, y, z)
2. hash(i, j, k) -> random seed
3. find # points in cell (poisson subroutine)
4. create this many random points
5. find nearest point to p
6. search adjacent cell too (repeat first 5 steps in 2D, 26 in 3D)

### Poisson Calculation
- Points per cell
1. Pre-compute:
    - P(0)
    - P(0) * P(1)
    - P(0) * P(1) * P(2)
    - ... ... ... P(6)
2. Pick random r in [0,1]
3. Find when r < P(0) + P(1) + ...+ P(i) then there are i points in cell

#### F2(p) - keep track of nearest 2 points

## Bump, Normal and Displacement Mapping

### Bump Map
- Jim Blinn
- smooth surface + wrinkle function = wrinkled surface
- shade based on combinatino of true and perturbed normal
- ![](wrinkNormal)
- image has gray scale values (map)
- ![](diagram)

### Normal Map
- image has color (r,g,b) values envoding vectors (dx, dy, dz) = D
- N' = N + D / || N + D ||

### Displacement Mapping
- Rob Cook
- actually move the surface points
- high quality but slower

#### Side Note:
- Use edge detection to use displacement on edges of objects and normal/bump map on interior of object
- Should get around the edges still looking smoothP(0) * P(1)
