## Flocking

### Why do creatures flock?
- Defense against predators
- Flight efficiency
- Finding a mate
- Finding food in groups

### Creatures have limited perception
- Flocks may be larger than the animals can perceive
- Creature decisions are then made using asubset of all creautures in the flock

### Boid Behaviors
- Stay close to the flock
- Avoid Collsions

### Boids
- Each boid has a state
  - Position (x, y, z)
  - Orientation
  - Velocity (x, y, z) (Orientation and speed)
- Velocity limits:
  - Minimum and maximum velocity

### Flocking Behaviors
1. Collision avoidance
  - Avoid collision with other boids
2. Velocity matching
  - Match this boid's velocity with boids near it
3. Flock ventering
  - Go near the other boids

### Finding nearby flockmates
- Within radius r
- Naive method O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Using grids O(n)
